# Fully automated Currency trader

This will be my second version of a trading bot. Check out my first version in the "MQL4_Trading_Bot" repository.

MQL5 is very similar to C++ and that is why it is my programming language of choise.

The trading bot is a pattern recognition program, it identifies mayor price level breakouts and enters trades when price returns to the mayor price level and show signs of rejection.

For now the whole repository contains all files for the MT5 program to allow me to test and compile code directly within VS Code.
